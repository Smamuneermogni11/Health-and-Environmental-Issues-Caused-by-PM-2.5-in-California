# Health-and-Environmental-Issues-Caused-by-PM-2.5-in-California
The following notebook is designed to show how particle matter 2.5 has had an adverse effect on health-related issues. There are several factors which have contributed to the rise of particle matter 2.5 such as the growth of wildfires. Other factors include the emissions from gasoline, oil, diesel and also wood, which is why the particle matter 2.5 rates have been higher over the recent years especially in dry climates. Particle Matter 2.5 has direct health issues related to the topic as well, which is what we are attempting to prove within this notebook and analysis. Our goal is to show that there has been an increase of Asthma related attacks and an overall increase of Asthma diagnosis in the Los Angeles area as they are one of the 5 areas with the highest particle matter 2.5 rating. “For PM2.5, short-term exposures (up to 24-hours duration) have been associated with premature mortality, increased hospital admissions for heart or lung causes, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, emergency room visits, respiratory symptoms, and restricted activity days. These adverse health effects have been reported primarily in infants, children, and older adults with preexisting heart or lung diseases. In addition, of all of the common air pollutants, PM2.5 is associated with the greatest proportion of adverse health effects related to air pollution, both in the United States and world-wide based on the World Health Organization’s” (California Air Resources Board, n.d., para. 5). Let this fact sink in there and then think about it, the World needs to change and make changes that can have a positive outlook on the development of the World and also take care of the people who have a chance to make a difference, the youth, and the population that give this nation the ability to continue to grow.
